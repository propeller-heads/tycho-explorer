# Progress

## What Works

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Monorepo Structure**: Clean organization with api/, frontend/, and docs/
- **Docker Deployment**: Multi-container setup with Docker Compose
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Separate API instances for Ethereum, Base, and Unichain
- **Development Environment**: Hot reload for both frontend (Vite) and backend (cargo-watch)
- **Simple Commands**: Makefile provides easy `make dev` and `make prod` commands

### Core Functionality
- WebSocket connection to Tycho backend for real-time pool data
- Pool List View with table display of pools
- Filtering by tokens, protocols, and pool IDs
- Sorting by protocol, fee rate, spot price, and last update
- Pool selection and detail sidebar
- Swap simulator for selected pools
- View switching between Pool List and Market Graph
- Token and protocol logo fetching from CoinGecko API

### UI Components Implemented
- Main application layout with header
- Pool table with infinite scroll
- Filter bar with multi-select dropdowns (recently refactored)
- Pool detail sidebar overlay
- Block progress indicator
- Token and protocol icons with fallbacks
- Generic filter components with virtual scrolling

### Recent Accomplishments (2025-06-11)

#### Pool Table UI Updates
- **Updated column header colors**: Changed from gray to Figma-specified `rgba(255, 244, 224, 0.64)` for consistency
- **Reordered table columns**: New order is Tokens, Pool ID, Fee rate, Spot price (lowercase), Protocol, Last update
- **Changed default sorting**: Updated from 'protocol_system' ascending to 'updatedAt' descending (most recent first)
- **UI consistency**: Ensures table headers match the warm cream color scheme throughout the application

#### Filter Component Refactoring
- **Extracted all style constants** to `filterStyles.ts` eliminating magic strings
- **Created generic components**: FilterPopover wrapper and FilterList with virtual scrolling
- **Reduced code by ~40%**: TokenFilterPopover from 161 to 89 lines, ProtocolFilterPopover from 87 to 66 lines
- **Extracted state management** into custom hooks (useFilterPopover, useFilterSearch, useVirtualList)
- **Fixed UI issues**: Made entire dropdown rows clickable, removed redundant token names
- **Simplified token search**: Now only searches by symbol (not name or address)
- **Improved architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with render helpers and shared infrastructure

## Current Status

The application is now properly structured as a monorepo with clear separation between frontend and backend services. Docker deployment is fully configured for both development and production environments. The Pool List View is functionally complete with the TC Design color system fully implemented. Multi-chain support allows switching between Ethereum, Base, and Unichain networks. The UI matches the Figma design's warm aesthetic with proper text colors, borders, and glass effects.

### Recent Accomplishments (2025-06-01)

#### WebSocket Connection Management
- **Fixed WebSocket termination issue**: Old connections were not properly closing when switching chains
  - Root cause: Event handlers remained active after disconnection
  - Solution: Nullify all event handlers (onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose) before closing
  - Result: Clean termination ensures users only see data from selected chain
- **Improved connection lifecycle**:
  - Uses `socketRef` to track current WebSocket instance
  - Prevents race conditions during chain switching
  - Ensures single active connection per session

### Recent Accomplishments (2025-06-03)

#### WebSocket URL Management Refactor
- **Removed all localStorage usage** for WebSocket URLs
  - Eliminated user-configurable URLs completely
  - WebSocket URLs now strictly from environment variables
  - Removed `websocketUrl` state from PoolDataContext
- **Simplified chain switching flow**:
  - Removed WebSocketConfig component entirely
  - Implemented direct chain selector in HeaderActions
  - Single-click chain switching with native HTML select
  - Connection status shown as colored dot (green/red)
- **URL state persistence**:
  - Chain selection stored in URL query parameter (?chain=Base)
  - Fixed race condition preventing URL-based chain loading
  - Shareable links with pre-selected chains
  - Browser navigation (back/forward) switches chains
- **Cleaner architecture**:
  - PoolDataContext reads initial chain from URL on mount
  - HeaderActions only updates URL when chain changes
  - No prop drilling - components use context directly
  - Removed ~150 lines of unnecessary component code

## Known Issues

1. **Logo Loading**: CoinGecko API rate limits can cause slow logo loading
2. **ScrollArea Integration**: Infinite scroll implementation may need refinement
3. **WebSocket Price Updates**: Server not sending price updates with new blocks, preventing edge widening visualization
4. **Graph Auto Re-center**: Graph occasionally auto re-centers (user decided not to fix)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Color System Evolution
1. Started with default purple/neutral theme
2. Identified need to match TC Design warm colors
3. Systematically updated all components to use `rgba(255, 244, 224, X)` values
4. User emphasized importance of full opacity (1) for text readability

### Border Implementation
1. Initially attempted complex gradient borders
2. Simplified to solid borders with low opacity for better performance
3. Documented gradient border technique for future use

### Component Architecture
1. Maintained separation between data logic (ListView) and presentation (PoolTable)
2. Kept filter state management in parent component
3. Used overlay pattern for pool detail sidebar
