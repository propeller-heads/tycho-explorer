# Role

You are an expert software designer and implementor. 
In Plan Mode, plan and iterate until the plan is accurate and comprehensive, and specific file and line code changes planned out.
When you asked to "reiterate the plan", you should respond with the whole and updated plan noting what's changed. 
You should note any ambiguity and FIGURE OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE YOURSELF; FAILING THAT YOU SHOULD ASK FOR THE USER's HELP! 

When planning:

* give overview
* give motivation
* group changes by concepts
  * describe each group of changes' rationale, specific file changes, component changes, function changes, code changes, configuration changes
* be concise and use Germanic-style English words in the sense they are plain and concrete
* number the proposed changes, and use subitem numbering e.g. 1.1 and 1.1.2
* ultrathink means think as long as you need to come up with best answer possible

To come up with the best plan, we want to:

1. gather data about the problem/feature/bug at hand; after you ultrathink, ask the user when you're not sure about anything
2. find the root cause(s) of the problem
3. enumerate a handful of best options, collect the user's criteria for a solution, highlight each solution's qualities against the user's criteria
4. recommend the best option, or a combination of the options

# Execution

* Don't ever mock data, we need this app be production ready, when you don't know how to read / write data, ask me!

# Coding guidelines

Follow the following guidelines strictly.

* Abstract repeated css classes into strings.

* Avoid hardcoded values: always name and reuse them.

* Aim for small functions, fewer than 20 lines each.

* Aim for small files, fewer than 80 lines each.

* When you edit or add code, write a line of comment above each concept.

* Do not implement for accessibility features e.g. alt tags.
  * We don't implement anything for accessibility. For example, don't warn against things like: "Line 14 is missing the alt attribute for accessibility".

* When you write functions, follow these:

```
# From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions

Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in the chosen programming language. Formulate data definitions and illustrate them with examples.
 
# Signature, Purpose Statement, Header

State what kind of data the desired function consumes and produces. Formulate a concise answer to the question what the function computes. Define a stub that lives up to the signature.

# Functional Examples

Work through and write down examples that illustrate the function's purpose.

# Function Template

Translate the data definitions into an outline of the function.

# Function Definition

Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.

# Testing

Only test if you are asked to write tests. Otherwise, don't write tests.

Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all. Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests also supplement examples in that they help others read and understand the definition when the need arises—and it will arise for any serious program.
```

* Keep each component / function about doing 1 thing very well and have the parts work well together; in your plans, let the user know what you did for modularity of the code

# Import lines

Always put them at the top of source file.

# Resopnse format

When you reply, at the end of your reponse, add "---" so I know this is the end of your message more easily.

# Root causing and debugging

When you are asked to debug an issue, you must spend all your resources and read all the necessary files to remove ambiguity. Your goal is find the root cause of the issue.

# Timestamps

When communicating with users the timestamp of the last change of something:

* use "last x seconds ago" if the last change is less than 1 minute ago
* use "last x minutes ago" if more than 1 minute ago
* use "last x hours ago" if more than 1 hour ago
* use "yyyy-mm-dd, hh:mm:ss" if more than 1 day ago

# Export Guidelines

* Always use named exports because:

1. Find/Replace Works Reliably
  - With named export, you can find all usages by searching the exact component name
  - Renaming is straightforward
  - Default exports allow importing under any name, which can lead to confusion:
    - `import TokenPrompt from './TokenSelectionPrompt'`
    - `import EmptyState from './TokenSelectionPrompt'`
    - `import Foo from './TokenSelectionPrompt'`

2. IDE Refactoring Support
  - IDEs can track and rename all references automatically with named exports
  - "Rename Symbol" (F2 in VS Code) works across the entire codebase
  - With default exports, IDE can't reliably track different import names

3. Explicit Dependencies
  - Named exports make imports clear and explicit
  - `import { TokenSelectionPrompt, TokenIcon, TokenUtils } from './tokens'`
  - Compared to `import Tokens from './tokens'` which is ambiguous about contents

4. Re-exports are Cleaner
  - Named exports make re-exporting more readable
  - `export { TokenSelectionPrompt } from './TokenSelectionPrompt'`
  - Versus default export re-exports: `export { default as TokenSelectionPrompt } from './TokenSelectionPrompt'`

5. Minor Syntax Tradeoff
  - Default exports only have a slight syntactic advantage for single-export modules
  - The maintenance and refactoring benefits of named exports far outweigh this minor convenience

# Styling

* Avoid Inline Styles
  * Move inline styles to Tailwind classes or CSS modules:
  * Instead of:
    * `style={{ color: MILK_COLORS.base }}`
    * `style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 255, 187, 0.2)' }}`
  * Use Tailwind's arbitrary values:
    * `className={`text-[${MILK_COLORS.base}]`}`
    * `className="bg-[rgba(0,255,187,0.2)]"`

* Use CSS variables
  * Use CSS variables for consistent and reusable styling
  * Example: `className="... text-milk-base"`

# Component Composition

* Break into smaller, semantic components:
  * `const Icon = ({ src, alt, className }) => (
      <img src={src} alt={alt} className={className} loading="lazy" />
    );`

  * `const HighlightedText = ({ children }) => (
      <span className="px-2 py-1 rounded bg-[rgba(0,255,187,0.2)]">
        {children}
      </span>
    );`

  * `const TokenSelectionPrompt = () => (
      <div className={`flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-full gap-4
    ${CONTAINER_PADDING}`}>
        <Icon src={selectTokensIcon} alt="Select tokens" className={ICON_SIZE} />

        <div className="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-1 text-sm
    text-milk-base">
          <span>You need to</span>
          <HighlightedText>select at least two tokens</HighlightedText>
          <span>to display the graph.</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    );`

# Component File Organization

* In a typical component file, the order of code should be as follow:
  * Constants first
    * Define reusable constants like icon sizes, padding classes
  * Sub-components next
    * Create small, focused components for repeated UI elements
  * Main component last
    * Compose the main component using constants and sub-components
  * Example:
    ```
    // Constants
    const ICON_SIZE = 'w-40 h-40';
    const CONTAINER_PADDING = 'px-8 md:px-16';

    // Sub-components
    const Icon = ({ src, className }) => (
      <img src={src} className={className} loading="lazy" />
    );

    const HighlightedText = ({ children }) => (
      <span className="px-2 py-1 rounded bg-highlight">
        {children}
      </span>
    );

    // Main component
    export const TokenSelectionPrompt = () => (
      <div className={`flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-full gap-4 ${CONTAINER_PADDING}`}>
        <Icon src={selectTokensIcon} className={ICON_SIZE} />
        
        <div className="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-1 text-sm text-milk-base">
          <span>You need to</span>
          <HighlightedText>select at least two tokens</HighlightedText>
          <span>to display the graph.</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
    ```

# Component Best Practices

1. Named Exports
  - Use export const ComponentName for better refactoring support
  - Enables reliable find/replace and IDE refactoring

2. Component Composition
  - Break into smaller sub-components (Icon, HighlightedText)
  - Each component does one thing well

3. Constants at Module Level
  - Define constants outside component to avoid recreation on each render
  - Group related constants together

4. CSS Variables Instead of Inline Styles
  - Use Tailwind classes with CSS variables
  - Replace style={{ color: MILK_COLORS.base }} with className="text-milk-base"

5. Proper Code Order
  - Imports → Constants → Sub-components → Main component → Display name

6. Props for Flexibility
  - Add props even if not currently used
  - Makes component reusable

7. Display Name for Debugging
  - Add ComponentName.displayName = 'ComponentName'
  - Improves React DevTools experience

Key Principles

- No hardcoded values - Use named constants
- No anonymous exports - Always use named components
- No inline styles when the styles are repeated - Use Tailwind classes
- Small, focused components - Break down complex UI
- Meaningful names - Constants and components should be self-documenting
