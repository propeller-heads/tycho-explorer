# CLAUDE.md - Development Guidelines

## ROLE & APPROACH

### Your Role
You are an expert software designer and implementor. In Plan Mode, plan and iterate until the plan is accurate and comprehensive, with specific file and line code changes planned out.

When asked to "reiterate the plan", respond with the whole updated plan noting what's changed. Note any ambiguity and FIGURE OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE YOURSELF; FAILING THAT, ASK FOR THE USER's HELP!

### Planning Process

When planning:
- Give overview
- Give motivation  
- Group changes by concepts
  - Describe each group's rationale, specific file changes, component changes, function changes, code changes, configuration changes
- Be concise using Germanic-style English (plain and concrete words)
- Number proposed changes with subitems (e.g., 1.1, 1.1.2)
- Ultrathink means think as long as needed for the best answer

To create the best plan:
1. Gather data about the problem/feature/bug; after ultrathinking, ask user when unsure
2. Find root cause(s) of the problem
3. Enumerate best options, collect user's criteria, highlight each solution's qualities
4. Recommend the best option or combination

## CODING STANDARDS

### General Principles
- **Small functions**: Keep function under 70 lines each
- **No hardcoded values**: Always name and reuse values
- **Comment concepts**: Write a comment above each concept
- **No accessibility features**: Don't implement alt tags or similar
- **Production ready**: Never mock data - ask when unsure about data handling
- **After every code change, lint the code on the files / directories changed**: `bun run lint file1 dir1`
- **After every code change, check imports use `@/` import alias**

### Function Design Process

Follow these steps when writing functions:

1. **Problem Analysis to Data Definitions**
   - Identify information to represent
   - Formulate data definitions with examples

2. **Signature, Purpose Statement, Header**
   - State what data the function consumes and produces
   - Write concise purpose statement
   - Define stub matching signature

3. **Functional Examples**
   - Work through examples illustrating the function's purpose

4. **Function Template**
   - Translate data definitions into function outline

5. **Function Definition**
   - Fill gaps in template using purpose statement and examples

6. **Testing** (only when requested)
   - Convert examples to tests
   - Ensure function passes all tests

### Modularity
Keep each component/function doing few things well. Each part of our system should group things coherently and be nicely independent from other parts of system. In plans, explain modularity decisions.

### Code Organization
- **Imports**: Always put at the top of source file
- **Import alias**: Use `@/` which represents `frontend/src/` (configured in vite.config.ts)
- **CSS classes**: Abstract repeated classes into strings
- **Always double check everytime you import, you use the import alias `@/`**
- **Use import `@/` alias**
  * Use tailwind css classes or create them
  * Consider making and using subcomponents, it's hard to big markup for SwapInterface.jsx

### Efficiency and Code Quality
- **Do not repeat yourself** - the multiple versions will get out of sync over time.
