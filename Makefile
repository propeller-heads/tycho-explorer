# Tycho Explorer Makefile - Simple Docker Commands
# =================================================
# This Makefile helps you run Docker commands more easily.
# Instead of typing long docker-compose commands, you can use short 'make' commands.

# How to use:
# -----------
# make <command> [options]
# 
# Examples:
#   make up                    # Start all services in production mode
#   make up DEV=1              # Start all services in development mode (with hot reload)
#   make up DEV=1 SERVICE=frontend  # Start only frontend in dev mode
#   make down                  # Stop all running services

# === Configuration Variables ===

# List of blockchain networks we support
CHAINS = ethereum base unichain

# Build service names by adding 'tycho-api-' prefix to each chain
# Result: tycho-api-ethereum, tycho-api-base, tycho-api-unichain
# NOTE: In production, all API services share the same Docker image (tycho-explorer/api:latest)
#       Only the first service builds it, others reuse it with different CLI arguments
API_SERVICES = $(addprefix tycho-api-,$(CHAINS))
API_SERVICES_DEV = $(addsuffix -dev,$(API_SERVICES))

# All services in our application
ALL_SERVICES = $(API_SERVICES) frontend
ALL_SERVICES_DEV = $(API_SERVICES_DEV) frontend-dev

# === Environment Setup ===
# DEV=1 switches between development and production modes

# Get worktree name from current directory for unique container naming
WORKTREE_NAME := $(shell basename $(CURDIR))

ifdef DEV
	# Development mode: use dev config files and show logs in terminal
	DC = docker-compose -p $(WORKTREE_NAME) -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev
	MODE_DESC = Development mode (hot reload enabled)
else
	# Production mode: use production config files and run in background
	DC = docker-compose --env-file .env
	MODE_DESC = Production mode
endif

# === Main Commands ===

# Default command when you just type 'make'
